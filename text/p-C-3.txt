Needless to say, Paris was pretty pleased with its new sewers. The city founded on the site of an early Roman city called Lutéce, had once relied on natural streams to wash away the waste. As the population grew, chamber pots were emptied into the streets and later cesspits and cesspools were used that required routine cleaning that the city couldn’t adequately provide. A series of cholera epidemics began and Paris was in short, a stinky mess. The 1840s-1890s saw the construction of “Les egouts”, a complex system of over 500 km of sewers under Paris. The once putrid city had come to possess one of the most comprehensive and efficient systems in Europe and by 1930, each street had its own sewer.
