Climbing to the Top of the Monastery
The coffee was delicious and the view was even more spectacular. I was tucked into a shady corner of an outdoor cafe at the base of the Monastery in Petra, Jordan. I had been sitting in my comfy red couch for long enough when a wiry Bedouin man of about 30 lifted his wrinkled chin to me, squinted his dark eyes, and shouted, “Where you from?”

“USA!” I responded. “You?” I thought I was being funny.

“My mother!” he called back. He was being even funnier.

I liked these guys immediately—they knew how to take a joke, and they knew how to give it just as good.

“You wanna go up top?” Mohammad asked. I grinned.

Just 30 minutes earlier I had been watching as Mohammed yelled at the German tourist. But when he offered to take me to the top, I didn’t speak a word of it. After all, this is their turf, and they can do as they please.

With long strides, Mohammad bounded towards the carved rock face of the Monastery and I followed behind him. When we arrived on the right side of it, where there was nothing but a vertical rock wall, he scaled right up it without even breaking stride.

With Spiderman-like glue on his feet, he stuck to the rock and leaned back down to extend his arm. I didn’t realize we’d be free-climbing 158 feet up a vertical cliff. I stopped for a second, questioning whether or not this was really such a good idea, and decided that if he could do it, I could, too.

I pretended not to see his outstretched arm and I pulled myself up behind him. Gasps echoed throughout the crowd that had been watching on from the cafe.

I got this.
