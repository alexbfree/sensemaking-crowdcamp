Once finished our culinary adventure, we headed out to see the busiest intersection in all of Hong Kong – let me tell you it was total madness!  I’m not one who’s too big on large crowds of people and found it was slightly uncomfortable, don’t let the smile in the picture fool you.  We then proceeded to Kowloon to the Ladies Markets where Katie bought herself an absolutely gorgeous white Asian style dress; I managed to pick up a gorgeous hot pink silk kimono for $120HK (roughly $15CDN).  We then decided to meet up with her colleagues and friends in Wan Chai for a night on the town.  After having a crazy time at one particular bar, we all decided to head over to Lan Kwai Fong – an internationally renowned party/clubbing district —  to finish off the night.  Lots of drinks, tons of dancing, and loads of laughs ensued.  Overall I’m pretty sure good times were had by all.
