After disembarking my fabulous first class flight, I made it through customs and before I knew it, was on the airport express train to Hong Kong Island where I would be meeting my friend Katie.  Katie and I had attended the same university and have some friends in common, so naturally when I decided on stopping in Hong Kong, I dropped her a line asking her what I should be checking out in the short time I had there.  Katie being the incredibly awesome person she is, offered for me to stay with her and told me that she would be more than happy to play tourguide to me, since sheâ€™s been living in Hong Kong for 3 years and knows it like the back of her hand.
