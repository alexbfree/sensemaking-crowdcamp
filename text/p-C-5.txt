I’m not exactly sure when or why the boat tours were scrapped, but the Museum of les Egouts de Paris is still a thing, and travellers looking to discover the underbelly, or should I say, the bowels of picturesque Paris, can visit from Saturday to Wednesday from €3,50. While some of you might be thinking the city would need to pay you to visit, the museum takes visitors through some rather impressive tunnels in the system and you’ll find Napoléon’s seal inscribed on many of the walls. It’s entrance is just a few minute’s walk from the Eiffel Tower. Which tourist would you be?
