Visiting the Ancient City of Petra, Jordan
Named as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, the “rose red city” is believed to have been built 2,300 years ago as the capital city of the Nabataeans (ancient Arabians). This city of stone lies among the Jordanian mountains in a large valley which runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. It is a half-built, half-carved red-rock city surrounded by towering sandstone passageways and gorges which seem to envelop anyone walking through them.

According to UNESCO, the ancient city of Petra “became, during Hellenistic and Roman times, a major caravan centre for the incense of Arabia, the silks of China and the spices of India, a crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia.”

Through annexation to the Romans and a large earthquake in 363 AD, trade routes began to change, and by the 7th century AD, the only people who remained in the city of Petra were the local Bedouin tribe. Petra was not even known to the Western World until the early 1800’s when a European traveler disguised himself as an Arab and snuck into the legendary city, revealing its existence to the rest of the world.
