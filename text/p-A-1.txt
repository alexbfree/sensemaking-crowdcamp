"Get down!” the local Bedouin man shouted. “Not allowed!” An awkward-looking twenty-something with blonde dreadlocks and a peach-fuzz beard peeked his head over the edge of the cliff and then quickly withdrew himself.

“No no! You come down! Police are here!”

I looked next to me—the skinny policeman was sprawled out across the entire couch, eyes locked shut, with a thick stream of saliva running down his hanging chin. He wasn’t waking up any time soon. Two more Bedouin men, with chiseled features, wavy, dark hair, and Jack Sparrow eye-shadow rushed the scene. They ran to the bottom of the Monastery and waited for the awkward twenty-something as he came scampering down on two very nervous legs.

“Whaaaaat?” I heard him stutter, in that drawn out German accent we travelers know so well. “What’s the problem?”

“Illegal!” the two pirates called out. “Give me entrance ticket. And passport!”

With a Turkish coffee in hand, I turned to check the couch again. The policeman had been shaken awake by one of the locals and, in his groggy state of delirium, was struggling to figure out what the hell was going on. An older authority figure with slicked-back hair and a powerful mustache stepped in and grabbed the German by the arm. I heard his poor excuses, acting like he didn’t know it wasn’t allowed, but the signs that said NO CLIMBING were just too big to be ignored. The locals handed over his entry ticket and passport to the mustachioed man, and I watched with delight as the German tourist was escorted away.
