Who are the Bedouins?
In Arabic, the word Bedouin literally translates to desert dweller. This community of nomads has been drifting across the Arabian and Syrian sands for centuries, living among the harsh landscape of the desert since long before the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ever existed.

The Bedouin tribe of Petra known as Al B’doul claim to be descendants of the Nabataeans who occupied the area at the culmination of the Roman Empire. They lived in the caves here for more than 170 years until 1985 when Petra National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site.

For preservation purposes, and with the help of UNESCO, Jordan forcibly resettled the B’doul from Petra to a nearby village. Petra is no longer an active city and is now a tourism destination largely run and operated by the Bedouins. The government provides the local population with assistance, education, and healthcare, but many still prefer the traditional nomadic way of life.

In an effort to reclaim their cultural identity, some B’doul have returned to the city of Petra against government ordinances.

As the Bedouins are travelers themselves, they are notorious for their hospitality towards other travelers they come across. The legendary laws of the Bedouin people dictate that, should a traveler stay with them for three days, no personal details are required, and the Bedouins will not ask for even their name. On the fourth day, however, there is a fee, and that fee comes in the form of information.

Pro tip: If you are traveling to the city of Petra on your own, bring your bags with you and make friends with the local Bedouins. They may offer to let you stay with them just outside the park, and though they may charge a nominal fee, the experience will be well worth it.
