So at roughly 8:45pm on a rainy Thursday evening, I stepped off the train and there was Katie waiting for me.  We grabbed a cab back to her place (North Point on Hong Kong Island), dropped off my stuff and promptly went for ‘hot’ sushi.  No – the sushi wasn’t hot; one of the boys working there is apparently very good looking , however he wasn’t working that evening so I didn’t get the full hot sushi experience (insert sadface here).  After a lovely dinner, we wandered around North Point before heading back to her apartment where we settled in and got some sleep.Friday morning we woke up bright and early, Katie headed to school and I headed to the MTR (the subway) and managed to make my way to OceanPark – an amusement park, which is the only place in the entire country/SAR/whatever you want to define Hong Kong as- to see pandas.  I wandered around for most of the day before heading over to Katie’s school to watch her volleyball team’s practice.  It unfortunately got rained out, so we had to leave early.
