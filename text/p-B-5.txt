The next morning was a rough start for us – not to say we were hung over, but just the general tiredness from being out super late + jet lag, made it hard for us to get our act together in a quick fashion.  Today’s adventure included going for REAL dim sum and getting four additional stamps in my passport!  Firstly, the dim sum.  We enjoyed suckling pig (sorry to those cute 3wk old piglets I saw at the CNE this summer- I probably ate one of your Asian cousins),  tendon curry (surprisingly nicer than I expected it to be), and some dumplings, amongst other strange and delicious things.  Then it was time to hop on the ferry to catch the one hour ride over to the little country of Macau!

We returned to Hong Kong around 10pm, but didn’t make it back to North Point until just after 11pm, when, surprisingly, all the restaurants around seemed to be closed!  Us being completely starved decided to settle on some poutine (Yes! With real cheese curds – but they used a curry gravy) and falafel & shawarma.  After feasting, chatting and watching copious amounts of Sex and the City we headed to bed.
