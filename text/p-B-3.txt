After returning home and freshening ourselves up, we headed out to Wan Chai where we went for Shanghainese food.  It was a culinary adventure, with the first dish being jellyfish! ACK!  To describe it:  cold, slimy, had an odd crunch to it, cut up into noodle-like pieces.  Glad I can say I tried it… don’t think I’d order it again though.  After that, the meal was more tame, but I did get to try these delicious dumplings: xiao long bao!  You basically have one chance to pick them up with your chopsticks without piercing them, because there is soup as well as some meat inside.  Once hoisted up in your chopsticks, you take a tiny nibble, suck out the soup, and then proceed to eat the rest of the dumping.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.
